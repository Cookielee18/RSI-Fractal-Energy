# RSI-Fractal-Energy
RSI Fractal energy indicator for trading view. 

This incorporates the Relative-Strength Index and Fractal Energy as the name implies.

This will help the trader identify:
1. Trend Strength: The higher the value of the indicator can indicate the strength of the trend and vice versa.
2. Reversal points: If the indicator is showing weakness and the market is making higher highs and lower lows this can indicate a reversal is possible.
3. Overbought and Oversold conditions: This indicator is currently set to 30(Oversold) and 70(Overbought), but this can be changed in the source code.

I also added a signal line to provide bullish/bearish crossovers.

I use this indicator on the 1 hr chart, but it can be used on any time frame.

Please let me know if you have any questions, comments, or concerns. Always open to learning more.

Feel free to apply the code to your tradingview account.
